# Office Norms for Cubespace
_Draft: February 9, 2017_

Our office space is a collaborative investment and this living document is meant to reflect that. The community will update it as needed. If you have any ideas on how to improve the office environment or this document, please email cubespace-norms@mit.edu.

Much of our work requires focus but also collaboration. Noise can be the byproduct of collaboration, which can break the focus of others; at the same time, collaboration often requires low barriers to conversation. The recommendations below help to balance the different types of work we all do throughout the day. 

The best guideline for all office etiquette: strive to understand and value what others need; and leave the office better than you found it. Or as Postel’s Law states: _**“Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others"**_

## Personal spaces

### General
- Treat cubes like offices: always knock before stepping into the cube; try not to surprise or startle anyone; come back later if they’re busy.
- Post a sign or flag at your cubicle entrance to signal when you’d prefer not to be interrupted.
- Promote a clean and organized workspace.  Don’t have items overflowing cubicles or blocking walkways.  
- Keep food items in sealed, airtight containers to minimize vermin issues.
- Respect your colleagues’ personal property and space. Always ask before borrowing anything.
- Resist reading other's computer screens. Privacy screens for monitors are available to anyone upon request. Contact Kelly.

### Critters
We need to work together as a community to keep Cubespace as free of vermin as possible.  While this isn’t entirely possible to do based on the building structure and age, there are some agreed upon basics we can implement.
- Trash is thrown out nightly Sunday through Thursday.  If you have food trash on a Friday night please dispose of it in a hallway trash can.
- Mousetraps in the office are a necessary reality.  If you see a sprung trap please tell Kelly.  If you see a trap with a creature in it please call facilities _immediately_ (FIXIT x3-4948).  They will send someone to take care of it.
- Sightings of live untrapped creatures in the office should be reported to facilities.  Sightings of droppings can be reported to Kelly.
- Cube floors and surfaces need to be kept as clean of nesting material as possible.  We have storage space available for boxes and bags.  Whenever possible, cardboard boxes need to be broken down and recycled.  In cube storage should be limited to airtight, hard sided containers.

### Noise
- Please use headphones when listening to music. If you need headphones, find ones you like and talk/email Kelly to purchase.
- Keep your computer volume low and turn off any sound effects.

### Phones 
- In the office, please set your cell phone on a low volume, or on vibrate/silent mode. 
- Set your desk phone ringer volume to a low level, and try to answer your phone quickly. Instructions for adjusting desk phone settings can be found here. 
- If you need to use a speakerphone for a conference call, use a room with a door and close it.
- When you leave your cubicle for extended periods (vacations, business trips, etc.), turn your desk phone ringer off and let it go to voicemail, or forward number to your new location.

### Talking
- Please use a quiet voice when talking in the common areas, your cube, and on the phone.
- If talking to multiple people, or one on one for more than a few minutes, spontaneously or otherwise, use a room with a door.
- If meeting in a room with a door, close it.
- If you wish to speak with someone, walk over to them or consider using a chat program like Slack. 

## Service, Therapy, and Companion Animals
MIT values the physical and emotional health of its employees and students; and the libraries have committed to fostering a healthy environment for the community. Service animals, therapy animals, and companion animals contribute to the physical and emotional health of the MIT community, but may also be a source of discomfort to members of the community.  
 
Service animals that support individuals with physical/intellectual/or behavioral disabilities must be allowed in all areas that are generally accessible to the MIT community; and MIT must also make any reasonable accommodations in restricted office spaces for employee service animals. Registered therapy animals provide emotional support to students, staff, and other members of the MIT community through initiatives sponsored by the Libraries, the Chancellor’s Office, MIT Medical and other MIT organizations: The presence of companion animals in public and in shared staff library spaces, in support of these events, and under the control of its handler (e.g. on leash/lead) should be welcomed unless they pose a health risk to identified staff or other members of the community. Companion animals, or “pets” provide informal emotional support to individuals in the community. Staff may bring companion animals to their private offices, unless the animals are unattended for long periods of time, or members of the community and staff are subject to more than minimal discomfort from their presence.  
 
Staff members who bring animals to campus are responsible for any resulting damage or cleaning; for maintaining constant control of the animal in all public spaces; and for ensuring that animals in private spaces are regularly attended.
 
Cubespace residents who plan to bring a therapy or companion animal into the communal areas or private offices should send e-mail to the cubespace-all reasonably in advance and should resolve any significant health or comfort (respectively) concern raised.

## Communal spaces
These spaces contain shared resources, e.g. the microwave and refrigerator, but also represent an opportunity to share what we bring, e.g. baked goods; and to interact and collaborate.  Maintaining these spaces is a shared responsibility.

### Kitchen
- Clean up after yourself before leaving kitchen area; i.e., promptly wash dishes when finished and don’t leave dirty ones in the sink. 
- Dishes should be removed from drying rack within a reasonable time after they become dry, within one day.
- Spills on the floor, counter, or refrigerator should be cleaned up as soon as they happen. 
- Please use your own mug to reduce waste and clutter in the cabinets.
- Remember to label your mugs, dishes, food items, etc. Unlabeled items will be assumed to be communal.   
- Be aware of how much space you use in the fridge and the age of your food items. 
- The kitchen and fridge will be cleaned thoroughly once a month. Volunteers will be incentivized.  

### Space issues
- Bikes are not permitted in MIT Buildings - please lock outside.

### Scents
- Be mindful of your neighbors regarding personal hygiene and odors such as perfume, cologne, flowers, smelly foods, etc. 
- If you have a particularly aromatic meal, eat in conference room or outside of Cubespace. 

## Meeting
Shared conference rooms are available for scheduled, and when possible, longer unscheduled conversations. When meeting in any of these spaces, please close the door. Both come equipped with a telephone and video conferencing capabilities.

## Raising Concerns
We should each attempt to address issues/concerns via collegial conversation before they escalate to where a supervisor would need to intervene.  There is no special process for escalating office norms issues/concerns beyond what is in place for other issues or concerns - consult with your supervisor, Associate Director, and/or HR.
